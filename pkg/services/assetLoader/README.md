# Unified Asset Loader

The purpose of this [Service Mesh](https://github.com/gravestench/servicemesh) service is to provide a single dependency
which has all file loading methods available for use by other high-level
D2 services.

## Dependencies

This service has dependencies on all other Diablo2 file-loader services:

* [dc6 loader service](../dc6Loader)
* [dcc loader service](../dccLoader)
* [ds1 loader service](../ds1Loader)
* [dt1 loader service](../dt1Loader)
* [fontTable loader service](../fontTableLoader)
* [gpl loader service](../gplLoader)
* [mpq loader service](../mpqLoader)
* [pl2 loader service](../pl2Loader)
* [tbl loader service](../tblLoader)
* [tsv loader service](../tsvLoader)
* [wav loader service](../wavLoader)

## Integration with other services

This service integrates with the following services:

* [config file service](../configFile)
* [lua service](../lua)
* [web router service](../webRouter)

The integration is optional; if neither are added to the servicemesh then the
integration methods will never be called.

This service exports an integration interface `LoadsDiabloFiles` with an alias
`Dependencncy` which are intended to be used by other services for dependency
resolution (see servicemesh.HasDependencies), and expose just the methods which
other services should use.

```golang
type LoadsDiabloFiles interface {
Load(filepath string) (io.Reader, error)
LoadDc6(filepath string) (*dc6.DC6, error)
LoadDcc(filepath string) (*dcc.DCC, error)
LoadDs1(filepath string) (*ds1.DS1, error)
LoadDt1(filepath string) (*dt1.DT1, error)
LoadGpl(filepath string) (*gpl.GPL, error)
LoadPl2(filepath string) (*pl2.PL2, error)
LoadTbl(filepath string) (tbl.TextTable, error)
LoadTsv(filepath string, destination any) error
LoadWav(filepath string) ([]byte, error)
}
```

## Config service integration

This service has a config file `asset_loader.json` where config options for
things like the sprite cache size can be found.

## Lua service integration

A global `assets` variable is exported to lua. At the time of writing, there is
a single `load` function which loads a file from the mpq loader and yields the
file data as an array of bytes.

Here is an example of its usage:

```lua
data = assets.load("/data/global/ui/Loading/loadingscreen.dc6")
```

## Web router service integration

If the [web router service](../webRouter) is present at servicemesh, this service will
register routes for retrieving data.

The route slug for this service is `asset`, so all routes defined will be under
that route group.

| route                             | method | purpose                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `asset/raw/*path`                 | GET    | yields the file for the given `path` from the mpq's         |
| `asset/sprite/png/:palette/*path` | GET    | yields a PNG sprite using the specified palette and file    |
| `asset/sprite/gif/:palette/*path` | GET    | yields an animated GIF using the specified palette and file |
